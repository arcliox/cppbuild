# Cppbuild
This is a simple prototype of a build system implemented in C++ to build C++ projects.

Idea, use C++ to build C++ projects. 

To try it out: 
```
mkdir ./bin
cd bin
g++ build.cpp -o build
```

Then simply run 
```
./build
```

If you want to see the main program in action you can execute:

```
./hello
```
